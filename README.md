# Generative AI Presenter
## Generate human-like voice over narrative for presentations using Generative AI

*  Utilizes the Multimodal Vision Model (GPT-4 Turbo Vision Preview) to interpret slides and create narrative content using visual prompting. Since slides often contain infographics, visual cues, etc., this helps to generate more relevant content compared to purely text-based prompting. 

* Uses the latest OpenAI text-to-speech(TTS) model to convert content into voice narration, making it more human-like. 

* Content is generated based solely on the slides; no additional Speaker notes, or input are required.

* Is capable of generating an engaging and accurate narrative for presentation with heavy infographics.
